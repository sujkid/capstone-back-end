## Planning and Development

1.  Come up with an idea for a full stack project!
1.  Designing the features by writing user stories and making frames.
1.  Developing the game by using the analysis and degign as input to write the code.
1.  Testing at various levels of development, and after.
1.  Bug fixing.

## Unsolved problems

-  The idea is to have multiple choices each day for users to choose.
-  I would like for users to leave reviews for each day's menu.
-  I would like to have a chef's profile, clicking on their profile would
   show their menu.
-  Right now, the menu page is seed data. I would love for chefs to sign up
   and upload their menus.
-  Stripe is not implemented, cash on delivery for now!
